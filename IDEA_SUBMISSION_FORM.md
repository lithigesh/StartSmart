### ðŸ”Œ Backend Integration

#### Current Backend Compatibility
The current backend model supports:
- `title` (String, required)
- `description` (String, required)  
- `category` (String, required)

#### Data Handling Strategy
For compatibility with the current backend, the form:
1. Sends only supported fields (`title`, `description`, `category`)
2. Combines comprehensive data into a formatted description
3. Stores complete form data structure for future backend expansion

#### API Endpoint
- **POST** `/api/ideas` - Submit new idea
- **Headers**: Authorization Bearer token
- **Body**: `{ title, description, category }`

### ðŸ“± Categories Available
- Technology
- Healthcare  
- Education
- Environmental
- Fintech
- E-commerce
- Social Impact
- Manufacturing
- Entertainment
- Food & Beverage
- Transportation
- Real Estate
- Other

### âœ… Validation Rules
- **Step 1**: All fields required (title, elevator pitch, description, category, target audience)
- **Step 2**: Problem statement and solution required
- **Step 3**: Revenue streams required
- **Final Submit**: All required fields must be completed

### ðŸŽ¯ User Experience
1. User clicks "Submit New Idea" button
2. Modal opens with step 1 of 8
3. User fills required fields and navigates through steps
4. Progress bar shows completion status
5. Final step allows file attachments
6. Submit button sends data to backend
7. Success message confirms submission
8. Modal closes and returns to dashboard

### ðŸ”® Future Enhancements
When backend model is expanded to support all fields:
1. Remove the description formatting workaround
2. Send structured data directly to backend
3. Add file upload handling to backend
4. Implement draft saving functionality
5. Add form autosave feature
