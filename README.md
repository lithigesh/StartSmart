## 1 Introduction

StartSmart is a full-stack web platform developed to help early-stage entrepreneurs validate their business ideas, request funding, and participate in ideathons or innovation challenges. The main goal of the application is to simplify and automate the startup evaluation process using artificial intelligence while supporting a smooth communication channel between entrepreneurs, investors, and administrators.

This project aims to solve a common problem faced by amateur founders and student innovators: lack of structure and expert insights when pitching business ideas. StartSmart bridges this gap by generating instant AI-driven assessments and enabling transparent, data-based decision-making for funding.

## 2 Problem Statement

Early-stage founders often lack access to proper evaluation mechanisms or expert support to assess the feasibility and potential of their ideas. Traditional funding or ideathon processes can be subjective, slow, and sometimes biased. There is also no uniform digital space where investors can track ideas, analyze submissions, and allocate funds based on real merit.

---

## 3 Objective of the Project

* Provide an AI-based evaluation system for startup ideas.
* Create a platform where entrepreneurs and investors can interact digitally.
* Introduce a structured and fair way to conduct ideathons and funding competitions.
* Reduce delays and manual work in idea selection and funding allocation.
* Make startup innovation more accessible in educational and entrepreneurial environments.

---

## 4 How the Platform Works

1. User registers and selects a role (Entrepreneur, Investor, Admin).  
2. Entrepreneurs submit their business ideas through a structured form.  
3. The platform analyzes submissions using AI and generates an evaluation report.  
4. Entrepreneurs can raise funding requests based on the evaluation.  
5. Investors view idea reports and decide whether to fund or reject requests.  
6. Admins manage users, submissions, ideathons, and platform activities.
